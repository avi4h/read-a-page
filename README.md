### Read-a-Page 

So basically this is just a simple reading app I have been tinkering with. Nothing too fancy.

#### What it does

The app lets you browse through a collection of book pages and read them in a clean, distraction free environment. 

- Bookshelf view 
- Reading view
- Basic controls 
- Search 
- Dark mode

#### Stack

**Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Zustand
**Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + REST API + Real-time)
**Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend) + Supabase (Backend)
**Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes
