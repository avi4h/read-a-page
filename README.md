### Read-a-Page 

So basically this is just a simple reading app I have been tinkering with. Nothing too fancy.

#### What it does

The app lets you browse through a collection of book pages and read them in a clean, distraction free environment. 

- Bookshelf view 
- Reading view
- Basic controls 
- Search 
- Dark mode

#### Stack

Built with React + TypeScript because thats what I know best. Using Redux for state management which might be overkill for this size project but whatever. Tailwind for styling.
